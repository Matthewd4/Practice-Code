# Practice-Code
This is a repository of my beginner code!

The Text-Based game is my first game I created using Python. It is called Corneluis V. Irus's Haunted Hospital, and the objective is to move around rooms collecting 6 items. Once you have the items you can go to the boss room and disinfect the hospital.
